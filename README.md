# loan_calculator
first beginning python project, a loan calculator which takes arguments from the terminal

Program expects the following arguments from the user, in addition to the file name: type (annuity or diff), monthly payment, principal, periods, interest

annuity will be a fixed payment for the duration of the life of the loan
differentiated ("diff) will be a monthly payment that changes each month for the duration of the life of the loan
**Either 'annuity' or 'diff' MUST be entered
additionally, an interest rate (no decimals, ie. 10% interest -> --interest=10) MUST be entered. 
otherwise, one of monthly payment, principals, or periods (how long the loan will last) can be left out. 

The program gives the information desired by leaving out the one of the arguments listed on line 10 above.
